# Bartok
A Django Backend for the Busti Church of God

## Introduction
Bartok is the backend application for Busti Church of God. It will feed
front end applications like the Busti Church of God App, and possibly a new site.
The current backend uses Wordpress and Advanced Custom Fields resulting in a clunky,
slow, and all around insufficient backend. Bartok will be made to service the needs of 
Busti Church of Gods from the ground up. Another key focus will also be the administrative aspect
of the application which will simplify the processing of information by the church office. 

## Planned Features

### Prayer Requests 
The prayer request functionality will allow users to submit prayer requests and praises. It will allow
for fine control over the privacy of the request. Users must be logged in to submit prayer requests to cut 
down on spam.
